// REST API endpoints
//
// Note: User creation is handled automatically via WebSocket authentication.
// When a client authenticates via WebSocket with HMAC, users are automatically
// created if they don't exist. See websocket.rs for implementation.
//
// Additional REST endpoints can be added here with proper HMAC authentication
// if needed in the future.
